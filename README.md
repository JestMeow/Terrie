Terrie is a script for procedurally generated terrain using 2 dimensional Perlin noise. However, this addon has a few problems to take into account when using. Because of this, I don't recommend copying the code of this script as there are probably better ways to do it. The problems that this script has is that it's slow, a bit laggy, and requires a decent amount of memory to run.

With that being said, I recommend using a strong device when using this addon.
